Hello-World for Unstructured HW1.
## About Me
### **General**
I am 22, a business student at Notre Dame, and very close with my family.
### **Interests**
I am a big fan of movies and keep track of what I watch. My top 10 is 1. *Goodfellas* 2. *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* 3. *Superbad* 4. *Annie Hall* 5. *It's a Wonderful Life* 6. *The Other Guys* 7. *Casablanca* 8. *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* 9. *Remember the Titans* 10. *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. There are also many Coen Brothers and Hitchcock films that I like, they just do not fit into my top 10.
I am also a big sports fan, with the Yankees, Jets, Islanders, and Celtics as my favorite teams besides Notre Dame. The Celtics may seem out of place, but my dad loved Larry Bird in college and decided to follow him to his team.
My favorite musicians are The Beatles, Kanye West, Billy Joel, Frank Sinatra, Childish Gambino, Bruce Springsteen, and Frank Ocean.
